    "Jeopardy! is a popular American game TV show that debuted in 1964 where contestants receive clues in the form of answers and must phrase their responses in the form of a question.\n",
    "We want to figure out which strategy has the most substantial chance of success, in other words which patterns we can extract from the data that could help a contestant prepare for Jeopardy. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to figure out whether to study past questions, study general knowledge, or not study it all, it would be helpful to figure out two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How often the answer can be used for a question;\n",
    "* How often questions are repeated;\n",
    "* Which terms correspond to high-value questions using a chi-squared test;\n",
    "* Which domain of questions constitutes the majority for the top categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project we are going to use a [dataset](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/1uyd0t/200000_jeopardy_questions_in_a_json_file) that contains 20000 rows from the full dataset of Jeopardy questions. Each row in the dataset represents a single question on a single episode of Jeopardy. Here are explanations of each column:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Show Number` - the Jeopardy episode number\n",
    "* `Air Date` - the date the episode aired\n",
    "* `Round` - the round of Jeopardy\n",
    "* `Category` - the category of the question\n",
    "* `Value` - the number of dollars the correct answer is worth\n",
    "* `Question` - the text of the question\n",
    "* `Answer` - the text of the answer"

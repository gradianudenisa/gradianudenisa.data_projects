#__Project 1: Hacker News__ <br>
[Click here to redirect to code](https://github.com/gradianudenisa/gradianudenisa.data_projects/tree/main/Project%20Hacker%20News)<br>
In this project we are analyzing a dataset of submissions to the Hacker News site, which is a site where posts receive votes and comments, similar to reddit. Hacker News is extremely popular in technology and startup circles, and posts that make it to the top of the Hacker News listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as #a result. In this context we are interested to know the following:


* Do Ask HN (meaning users submiting a post to ask the Hacker News community a question) or Show HN (meaning users submiting a post to show the Hacker News community a project, product etc.) receive more comments on average?
* Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average

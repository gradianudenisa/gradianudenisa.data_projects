#__Project 1: Hacker News__ <br>
[Click here to redirect to code](https://github.com/gradianudenisa/gradianudenisa.data_projects/tree/main/Project%20Hacker%20News)<br>
In this project we are analyzing a dataset of submissions to the Hacker News site, which is a site where posts receive votes and comments, similar to reddit. Hacker News is extremely popular in technology and startup circles, and posts that make it to the top of the Hacker News listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as #a result. In this context we are interested to know the following:


* Do Ask HN (meaning users submiting a post to ask the Hacker News community a question) or Show HN (meaning users submiting a post to show the Hacker News community a project, product etc.) receive more comments on average?
* Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average

The goal of this project is to use and apply various data cleaning techniques to:
* transform numeric data stored as text which should be cleaned and converted, 
* removing outliers, 
* dealing with incorrect data, 
* mapping german words to their english counterparts etc.<br><br>
and to analyze and explore the included used car listings, namely:<br><br>
* exploring variations of price across different car brands, 
* exploring average mileage for top 6 cars (by price) and if there's any visible link with mean price, 
* finding the most common brand/model combinations, 
* finding how much cheaper are cars with damage than their non-damaged counterparts etc.

#__Project 3: Heavy Traffic Indicators__ <br>
[Click here to redirect to code](https://github.com/gradianudenisa/gradianudenisa.data_projects/tree/main/Project%20Heavy%20Traffic%20Indicators)<br>
Our analysis goal is to determine indicators of heavy traffic on I-94. After processing the data, we are going to use various exploratory data visualziation techniques (like vsualizing time series data with line plots, visualizing correlations with scatter plots, visulizing frequency distributions with bar plots and histograms, comparing graphs using grid charts) to investigate data and find patterns.<br><br>
After a rigorous examination, we managed to find two types of indicators of heavy traffic on I-94:

__Time indicators__
* The traffic is usually heavier during warm months compared to cold months.
* The traffic is usually heavier on business days compared to the weekends.
* On business days, the rush hours are around 7 and 16.
__Weather indicators__
* Shower snow
* Light rain and snow
* Proximity thunderstorm with drizzle
